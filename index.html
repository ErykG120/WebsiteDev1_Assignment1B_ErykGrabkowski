			<h3>Sidebar - Latest Updates!</h3>
			<h4>Assignment1b Uploaded!</h4>
			<p>Assignment1b has finally been finished and uploaded after a continuous struggle of updating old code...</p>
			<h4>Assignment1a Uploaded!</h4>
			<p>Assignment1 has finally been finished and uploaded after a struggle of forming code...</p>
			<h4>Weekly Practicals Accomplished!</h4>
			<p>Weekly practicals have been going great so far with very few issues and are typically fast to solve! They are
			honestly the best way to learn everything we learn as it makes you put your knowledge to use and is a great way to
			practise too!</p>
			<h3>Small Note For Deirde</h3>
			<p>I took some elements from the old website but changed around a lot of the code as I couldn't get my spaghetti
			code to work properly with the semantic tags. I also wanted to change around the look and the content of the website
			as it didn't reallty fit the new style and such. I added the link styling that I was missing last-time like was
			asked and hopefully added all the new Semantic tags and everything else that is required.</p>

				<h2>Welcome To My Website!</h2>
				<p>Thank you for visiting! This website has been made by me for personal reasons along with being an assignment for
				my Web Development module. It has been an experience to say the least. While Web Development is fun at first, and
				it really is... it can become difficult to understand at times and worst of all is attempting to implement the code
				you have learned for your assignments because it's a game of trial and error to make sure everything works the
				exact way you want it. I really do enjoy this module though and I hope to continue and improve and hopefully in the
				future make a website that I am really satisfied with!</p>
