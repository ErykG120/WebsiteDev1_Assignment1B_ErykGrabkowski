			<h3>Sidebar - Latest Updates!</h3>
			<h4>Assignment1b Uploaded!</h4>
			<p>Assignment1b has finally been finished and uploaded after a continuous struggle of updating old code...</p>
			<h4>Assignment1a Uploaded!</h4>
			<p>Assignment1 has finally been finished and uploaded after a struggle of forming code...</p>
			<h4>Weekly Practicals Accomplished!</h4>
			<p>Weekly practicals have been going great so far with very few issues and are typically fast to solve! They are
			honestly the best way to learn everything we learn as it makes you put your knowledge to use and is a great way to
			practise too!</p>
			<h3>Small Note For Deirde</h3>
			<p>I took some elements from the old website but changed around a lot of the code as I couldn't get my spaghetti
			code to work properly with the semantic tags. I also wanted to change around the look and the content of the website
			as it didn't reallty fit the new style and such. I added the link styling that I was missing last-time like was
			asked and hopefully added all the new Semantic tags and everything else that is required.</p>
